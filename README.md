# AutoGameJournal
Utility that will periodically save screenshots of your gameplay to disk. Meant as a way to look back upon sessions or playthroughs without committing the disk space for a full video stream. By default any fullscreen window is considered a 'game'.

Screenshots are organized by having one folder per game, with the time of the screenshot in the file name.

Games are differentiated by executable name, falling back to the name of the window if things like anti-cheat prevent this from accessing the process.
